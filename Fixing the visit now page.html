            It was the place for the isolated lepers until 1957. Spinalonga  opened the gates at 30 May of 1903 to accommodate 250, <br>
            patients, the 148 was males and 103 females. After 1913 more ill people were abandoned with the stigma of leprosy<br>
            and the shameful style of that time to be a leper. That small prison transformed into a permanent home for the lepers<br>
            for more than 50 years. A community started to grow inside the island. People had their homes, shops, church, and hospital<br>
            In 1950 Spinalonga closed its doors to lepers after the disease was fought with the discovery of the vaccine.
